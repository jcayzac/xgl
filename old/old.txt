XGL is a static library. It makes using OpenGL easier, as it dynamically loads
any OpenGL driver and GLU library at runtime, loads every single OpenGL
extension automatically, performs function aliasing on deprecated unmodified
extensions versions, and has an OpenGL states manager (in the
development/unstable release) which increase performances.

Download XGL 0.4 for Unix and Win32 (.tar.gz archive).
You can also get XGL 0.5-dev, the current "not-so-much-tested" development
version. New: transparent OpenGL states manager (WARNING: enabling it on a
Win32 platform has been reported to crash the application. I must investigate
that).
